timeEst is a node.js + express.js application that uses the google maps API to give directions and a time estimate for travel

Current version: .7 (beta)

Bugs: 
Sometimes google maps provides directions to the wrong address (it might have a similar sounding name or be on street of the same name, but in a different state). 

Future Features: 
Allowing the user to select what time they want to arrive or what to depart by
    The way the app is currently set up this is impossible due to restrictions google has place on the API. There is a way to do it,         which would involve making an HTTPS request instead of using google.maps.DirectionsRenderer and google.maps.DirectionsService. Once      this is done, I will have to display the info by hand instead of using DirectionsRenderer.setDirections(response). It will take some     time, but it will be done.

Add a proper UI using backbone.js

Info:

In order to run this application, you will need to have a couple google maps API keys, which you can get from https://developers.google.com/maps/?hl=en Add this API key in the index.html file.

You will also need to have node.js and express.js downloaded. You can find info on how to run this application at http://expressjs.com/
